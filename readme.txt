Keep spam bots out of your site without annoying Captcha codes, puzzles or faulty blacklists. Enterprise spam protection for sites of all sizes.

== Description ==

Register for free to put an end to those annoying Captcha codes that slow down or even send away your users! NoMoreCaptchas authenticates human beings based on the one thing that can never be faked - their behavior. 

= Now with Faster Service and Even Easier Contact Form 7 Support! =

Developed at Oxford University, NoMoreCaptchas uses e-DNA (Electronically Defined Natural Attributes) to determine if a user is a human or a bot. Bots are sent away. Humans are welcomed into your site - and without any puzzles, roadblocks or error-prone black lists to worry about.

Installation is simple and you can monitor it working through your own personal dashboard. Just register, download and install to see it work.

NoMoreCaptchas is free for personal use. For companies and other groups with needs beyond the personal blog or small site, we offer subscription-based services. 
For more information, please visit http://www.NoMoreCaptchas.com

Note: You must register (it's free!) at http://www.NoMoreCaptchas.com/register to keep those bots away!

That's all there is to it!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= If I'm using the free version, do I still have to register? =
Yes. In order to ensure your site is protected, we must open access to our cloud-based service to your site. In order to do that, we need to know you want to connect to us. Please take a moment to register. It really takes just a minute or two!

= What makes NoMoreCaptchas different? =
We don't use traditional Captcha, or problem-solving methods to make a user prove he or she is human. Most people find that annoying, and user studies show that 74% of the time, people will abandon a site that makes them solve a Captcha code. 
We also don't use blacklists and whitelists to cross check users. Those databases are as fallible as the humans who maintain them and can be wrong. And if you're the one who has been accidentally listed as spam, Spamhaus and the other 5 leading spam databases have a long, opaque procedure for getting yourself off of them. It's a frustrating experience. And even if you're fine, cross-checking database lists creates a lag for the user.
What we use is a user's e-DNA, or Electronically Defined Natural Attributes, to determine whether the user is a bot or a human. Since even the best bots only poorly mimic a few human attributes, we detect them and block them from your site. And users don't need to do anything but be themselves, so they don't slow down and your engagement goes up.

= What exactly is biochronometric protection? =
Bio means life and chrono means time. We devised unique signatures based to determine whether someone is acting alive over time based on hundreds of individual user inputs that people automatically generate just simply by being alive. The time we need to figure out if you're alive or a bot is just fractions of a second. And since bots can't fake being alive, we can be sure we block them and let only real humans enjoy your site.

= Is there a free version? =
Yes. You can install and use NoMoreCaptchas for free for personal use and enjoy protection for up to 2,500 bot attacks per month. That is plenty for a small, personal site or blog.

If your site is not for personal use, NoMoreCaptchas is free for the first 30 days. After that, or even if you run a personal site and desire a greater level of protection and want more functionality in your dashboard, we have a variety of subscription services available. You can read about them at http://nomorecaptchas.com/pricing/

= Who shouldn't use NoMoreCaptchas? =
Spammers, scammers, bots, trolls and other Internet bottom-dwellers really should avoid NoMoreCaptchas. We're out to make their lives difficult, so they really don't like us.

= What do I need to install NoMoreCaptchas? =
Installing NoMoreCaptchas is easy. All you need are the plugin zip file and your License Key.

To get your License Key, register your site with us at http://nomorecaptchas.com/register/. As soon as you do, we'll send you a license key and a unique download link.

Registering allows us to create a unique key for your site that will make your NoMoreCaptchas keeps spam bots away and only allows humans through the door.

= Is NoMoreCaptchas compatible with BuddyPress? =
Yes. We have tested it up to the latest release (BuddyPress 2.0.1) and it is compatible.

= Which pages does NoMoreCaptchas protect? =
NoMoreCaptchas prevents spambots from registering or logging in to your site, and as of version 1.2.4, it also protects your contact forms and public comment sections. So the login page is protected and, if you use BuddyPress' registration page, that is also protected - and now so are your contact forms.

In other words, it protects the pages where you would normally place a Captcha code.

= How do I set up protection for my contact forms? =
We have optimized NoMoreCaptchas to work with Contact Form 7, the most widely used contact form plugin. All you have to do is place the NoMoreCaptchas code in the same place as your Contact Form 7 shortcode and you're all set.We posted the instructions for you here: http://nomorecaptchas.com/configure-contact-form-7. 
If you use a different contact form plugin, please contact us at support@nomorecaptchas.com and we can help you set it up.

= How can I tell if NoMoreCaptchas is working? =
Seeing NoMoreCaptchas in action is believing, and there's no better place to see it happen than your Dashboard, located at http://nomorecaptchas.com/customer-dashboard/. If you have a free version of NoMoreCaptchas, you'll see the last 400 actions. If you're one of your subscribers (thanks!) you'll be able to customize your view.

To log in to your NoMoreCaptchas Dashboard, visit the Customer Dashboard page (http://nomorecaptchas.com/customer-dashboard/) and enter your Authenticating Code and the domain you registered. 

= I'm still getting spam, what's happening? =
If NoMoreCaptchas is properly installed (see above) and you are able to see your dashboard, there are a few possible issues:

* You may not have registered. If you believe you did (or if you're a subscriber, if know you are up to date on your payment but are not listed as active), please contact us at support@nomorecaptchas.com

* If that's not the case, then your License Key was not properly entered into the control panel. Please be sure to copy and paste it directly from the email we sent you. If you no longer have your License Key, please contact us at support@nomorecaptchas.com so we can send you a new one.

* There may have been some spam registrations pending in your queue. Please make sure you have eliminated anyone who got in before you installed NoMoreCaptchas.

* The only other reason you might be getting spam is if an actual human decided to register on your site and spam you personally. Believe it or not, some people have that kind of time on their hands. That's not the way most spammers operate, so it's probably someone you recently beat in a game of WoW or didn't like something you said on Reddit.

= Is NoMoreCaptchas an accessible (508-compliant) solution? =
Yes. Section 508 of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires websites to be built in such a way that the blind, visually impaired and others with disabilities are able to use the site without issue. Most Captcha solutions are very difficult for those with visual impairments, and the audio solutions are a clumsy workaround at best.
Since NoMoreCaptchas doesn't require users to do anything but be human, the path is made equally accessible to everyone.


== Screenshots ==
1. NoMoreCaptchas scans for human behavior when a user enters a user name and password.
2. When it recognizes a human, it welcomes them to your site.
