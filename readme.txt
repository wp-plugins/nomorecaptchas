Stop spam bots from registering, logging in and commenting on your site without using annoying Captcha codes, puzzles or faulty blacklists.

== Description ==

Put an end to those annoying Captcha codes that slow down or even send away your users! NoMoreCaptchas authenticates human beings and blocks bots based on the one thing that can never be faked - their behavior. 

It's enterprise-level spam protection for sites of all sizes.

New for NoMoreCaptchas 2.0!
* Protects comment and ContactForm7 forms as well as registration and login pages automatically 
* Automatic protection for comments
* More free verifications each month
* Lower prices for subscribers
* Built-in dashboard so you can see it work and keep track of who and what is trying to access your site
* Contact Form 7 compatibility now with no extra coding

Developed at the University of Oxford, NoMoreCaptchas uses e-DNA (Electronically Defined Natural Attributes) to determine if a user is a human or a bot. Bots are sent away. Humans are welcomed into your site - without any puzzles, roadblocks or error-prone black lists to worry about - and without any content scanners that read your private messages before you do!

With version 2.0, you have a dashboard right on your site where you can see it work and keep track of who is being let in and what is kept out. 

NoMoreCaptchas is free for personal use and for registered charities. For companies and other groups with needs beyond the personal blog or small site, we offer subscription-based services. 
For more information, please visit http://www.NoMoreCaptchas.com

Note: Be sure to register (it's free!) at http://nomorecaptchas.com/#!/register to activate your NoMoreCaptchas and keep those bots away!

== Installation ==

Installing NoMoreCaptchas is as simple as 1-2-3!. All you need is the plugin and a License Key. Here's how you do it:

1: Register  
Even if you're using NMC for free, you have to register to enjoy its protection. It takes 2 minutes - just go to http://nomorecaptchas.com/#!/register to receive your License Key. 

2: Install  
Install NoMoreCaptchas the way you would any plugin.

3: Validate  
By the time you've installed and activated the plugin, you'll have an email in your inbox with your License Key. Simply copy and paste that into the Settings>NoMoreCaptchas page and click on Validate. 

That's all there is to it!

Please note: We strongly recommend turning off trackbacks and pingbacks in the WordPress Discussion Settings. They’re a back door for spam to exploit no matter what kind of protection you have.


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= If I'm using the free version, do I still have to register? =
Yes. In order to ensure your site is protected, we must open access to our cloud-based service to your site. In order to do that, we need to know you want to connect to us. Please take a moment to register. It really takes just a minute or two!

= Is there a free version? =
Yes. You can install and use NoMoreCaptchas for free for personal use and for registered charities and enjoy protection for up to 10,000 bot attacks per month. That is plenty for most small sites.

If your site is not for personal use, NoMoreCaptchas is free for the first 30 days. After that, or even if you run a personal site and desire a greater level of protection and want more functionality in your dashboard, we have a variety of subscription services available. You can read about them at http://nomorecaptchas.com/ #!/pricing

= Is NoMoreCaptchas compatible with BuddyPress? =
Yes. We have tested it up to the latest release (BuddyPress 2.3.2.1) and it is compatible.

= Which pages does NoMoreCaptchas protect? =
NoMoreCaptchas prevents spambots from registering or logging in to your site as well as commenting. It also protects your ContactForm 7 forms. 

In other words, it protects the pages where you would normally place a Captcha code.

= How do I set up protection for my contact forms? =
For Contact Form 7, it’s automatic. If you use something different, please let us know and we can look into putting it in our development queue. 

= How can I tell if NoMoreCaptchas is working? =
Seeing NoMoreCaptchas in action is believing, and there's no better place to see it happen than your Dashboard. With version 2.0, your dashboard is located on your site under Dashboard>Settings> NoMoreCaptchas.

= I'm still getting spam, what's happening? =
If you just installed NoMoreCaptchas, there are a few things that could be happening:
* This bit of spam was in the queue and your site pushed it live after NoMoreCaptchas was installed. Queues tend to lag up to 48 hours behind what goes live. Check your pending comments and users to make sure you don’t have a queue built up.

* You may not have registered. If you believe you did (or if you're a subscriber, if know you are up to date on your payment but are not listed as active), please contact us at support@nomorecaptchas.com

* If that's not the case, then make sure your License Key was not properly entered into the control panel. Please be sure to copy and paste it directly from the email we sent you. If you no longer have your License Key, please contact us at support@nomorecaptchas.com so we can send you a new one.

= Is NoMoreCaptchas an accessible (508-compliant) solution? =
Yes. Section 508 of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires websites to be built in such a way that the blind, visually impaired and others with disabilities are able to use the site without issue. Most Captcha solutions are very difficult for those with visual impairments, and the audio solutions are a clumsy workaround at best.

Since NoMoreCaptchas doesn't require users to do anything but be human, the path is made equally accessible to everyone.

= What do I need to install NoMoreCaptchas? =
Installing NoMoreCaptchas is easy. All you need are the plugin zip file and your License Key.

To get your License Key, register your site with us at http://nomorecaptchas.com/#!/register. As soon as you do, we'll send you your license key.

Registering allows us to create a unique key for your site that will make your NoMoreCaptchas keeps spam bots away and only allows humans through the door.

= What makes NoMoreCaptchas different? =
Our technology was developed at the University of Oxford when our founders where there as cryptography researchers. It verifies humans and blocks bots based on user behavior. We don’t use puzzles or tricks. Our method can’t be hacked or spoofed. It’s passive (no one needs to do anything) and always on, so you are always protected. Plus it’s self-learning, so as time goes on and bots change their tactics, our technology changes to keep blocking them.

We also don't use blacklists and whitelists to cross check users. Those databases are as fallible as the humans who maintain them. They can fail to block new bots and even keep out humans whose sites or IP addresses have been taken over without them knowing it.
 
What we use is a user's e-DNA, or Electronically Defined Natural Attributes, to determine whether the user is a bot or a human. Since even the best bots only poorly mimic a few human attributes, we detect them and block them from your site. And users don't need to do anything but be themselves, so they don't slow down and your engagement goes up.

= Why not just use a CAPTCHA code? =

Traditional CAPTCHA, Recaptcha and other solutions that challenge a user to solve a problem drive users away. Stanford University researchers conducted a great study on CAPTCHAs use and found that over half of all users either leave as soon as they see a Captcha-style puzzle or fail to get it right. 

We don’t believe anyone can afford to send over half of their users away, so we came up with something that is simple and reliable – and does not require users to do anything but use your site.

= What does your name mean? What are biochronometrics? =
Bio means life, chrono means time and metrics are measurements. So we measure life signs over time to determine whether something is a bot or human. That time usually takes about 500 milliseconds and starts while the page is loading. Humans never notice a delay and their behavior lets them in. Bots’ behavior blocks them out and even the best bots cannot fake being human.

= Who shouldn't use NoMoreCaptchas? =
Spammers, scammers, bots, trolls and other Internet bottom-dwellers really should avoid NoMoreCaptchas. We're out to make their lives difficult, so they really don't like us.


== Screenshots ==
1. NoMoreCaptchas scans for human behavior while a user enters a user name and password.
2. When it recognizes a human, it welcomes them to your site - usually within just a fraction of a second.
3. You can see it in action on your Dashboard. Check who is being let in and what's being blocked - and what pages they are trying to access.
