NoMoreCaptchas keeps spam bots out of your site and only allows human beings to register or login without annoying Captcha codes or faulty blacklists.

== Description ==

NoMoreCaptchas puts an end to annoying Captcha codes that send away many users and authenticates human beings based on the one thing that can never be faked - their behavior. 

Developed at Oxford University, this technology uses bio-chronometric markers that cannot be copied. They are created when a person interacts with almost any modern computing device that can accept human-initiated input. 

Since its behavior that's being examined, there's no whitelist, blacklist or roadblocks for users - just easy access for all human beings. And that means the end of the road for spam bots.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What makes NoMoreCaptchas different? = 

We don’t use traditional Captcha, or problem-solving methods to make a user prove he or she is human. Most people find that annoying – and user studies show that 74% of the time, people will abandon a site that makes them solve a Captcha code. 
We also don’t use blacklists and whitelists to cross check users. Those databases are as fallible as the humans who maintain them and can be wrong. And if you’re the one who has been accidentally listed as spam, Spamhaus and the other 5 leading spam databases have a long, opaque procedure for getting yourself off of them. It’s a frustrating experience. And even if you’re fine, cross-checking database lists creates a lag for the user.
With the biochronometric technology in NoMoreCaptchas, users don’t need to do  anything but be themselves. Our analytics know faster than they do whether they’re human or bots.
As a matter of fact, we don’t ask users to do anything at all. Instead, we use our advanced biochronometric technology to analyze In , 2  factor device authentication, the Company has devised unique signatures based on hundreds of individual inputs of users of both mobile and traditional desk top computing devices, allowing for BioChronometric authentication and authorization on virtually all current available devices.  The algorithms, protected by trade secrets and patents pending, can’t currently be replicated by humans or bots, creating passive, always on security for all on line applications.

= What exactly is biochronometric protection? = 
Bio means life and chrono means time. We devised unique signatures based to determine whether someone is acting alive over time based on hundreds of individual user inputs that people automatically generate just simply by being alive. The time we need to figure out if you’re alive or a bot is just fractions of a second. And since bots can’t fake being alive, we can be sure we block them and let only real humans enjoy your site.

= Does anyone else do what you do?= 
No. Many are trying to figure out what we’ve already done. This is the way authentication technology is moving, but no one has found and packaged the solution like we have. We spent years of research at Oxford University to come up with what we have. We may get some true competitors some day, but right now, we’re speeding down the highway while everyone else in the market is basically still using a horse and buggy.

=Is NoMoreCaptchas a 508-compliant solution?=
Yes. Section 508 of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires websites to be built in such a way that the blind, visually impaired and others with disabilities are able to use the site without issue. Most Captcha solutions are very difficult for those with visual impairments – and the audio solutions are a clumsy workaround at best.
Since NoMoreCaptchas doesn’t require users to do anything but be human, the path is made equally accessible to everyone.
